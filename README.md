**R Project (Breen_CodeSample.Rproj):**

When opening this project file from within the project folder (Breen_CodeSample), R Studio will open to the correct working directory with access to the data files and accompanying R Script

**Data Files (_.csv):**

National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data F-33 Survey of School District Finances (SY 07-08 to SY 18-19), includes information on school nutrition program revenues from federal (C25), state (C10), and paid meal sources (A09), adoption into the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), and school district characteristics

**R Script (Breen_CodeSample.R):**

This code walks through steps to 1) clean the data for all years of analysis, 2) describe the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations, 3) find inequality measures for the main revenue of interest, and 4) explore the effect of adopting CEP on the main revenue of interest. I also explore heterogeneity by urbanicity of school districts. 

**Code Outputs (Cleaned Data & Plots):**

•	Cleaned datasets are exported to the folder “Cleaned Data”

•	Plots are exported to the folder “Plots”
